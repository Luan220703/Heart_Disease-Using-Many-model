# Heart_Disease-Using-Many-model
I use many models and methods to compare the accuracy of predicting heart disease data. The goal here is not to put it into medicine because this is just an experiment. 
I wrote paper for this and the accuracy is good and fit to my intent.Link to this data is in Kaggle AND THE link is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. It's very famous and I hope that You can use many other Models to get better performance for this dataset.
